.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B \*p
is a utility intended to enable use of a Spaceball to manipulate zoomable
extra views of one or more current X windows using OpenGL.
.LP
Several Spaceball buttons have special uses:
.LP
.B 1
add a X window (which is selected with mouse button 1) to \*p.
.LP
.B 2
clear all windows from \*p.
.LP
.B 3
toggle from full-view mode to correct-aspect mode.
.LP
.B 5
snap back to the initial viewpoint.
.LP
.B 10
(button 5, held, on the SpacePilot PRO)
toggle window animation.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
To have \*p default to making a window on the current display, and
allow the user to select the window to view in it with the mouse:
.IP
.B \*p
.LP
To display a specific window by its X window ID:
.IP
.B \*p
.I window-id
.LP
To bring up a window on the current display, and a second on another 
display (noting that the mapped X windows probably won't be visible):
.IP
.B \*p --display
.I other-display
.B \--port --display
.I this-display
.B \--port
